Implementation of Naïve Bayes algorithm for text classification tasks. The version of naïve Bayes that is used is called the multinomial naïve Bayes (MNB).
To test your algorithm, you will use the 20 newsgroups dataset, which is available for download from here: http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/
Program outputs accuracy obtained on the test portion to the stdout.
